## Install

```
git clone git@github.com:textileio/js-threads-client.git
cd js-threads-client
npm i
```

If you want to run the tests in both browser and Nodejs, you'll need to install a recent [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/) or [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser.

## Tests

```
npm run test
```

Or to do just Nodejs or browser:

```
npm run test:{node,browser}
```

## Basic use in Typescript

**create a client**

```js
this.client = new Client('http://localhost:6007')
```

**create a store**

```js
const store = await this.client.newStore()
await this.client.registerSchema(store.id, 'Folder2P', schema)
```

**join a store by invite**

```js
const store = await this.client.newStore()
await this.client.registerSchema(store.id, 'Folder2P', schema)
try {
  const some = await this.client.startFromAddress(
    store.id,
    '/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/4006/p2p/12D3KooWS2QMPk53mi6xzjr6j87bB9NDfn6NnnQWFc31p86SwpBW/thread/bafktbzj3z4gc7x44dc7izjieurbboybszntx6vapj3umytpilvuqjva',
    'stAhc51y6tnTdDGxSzA9rrSgjudzenwF6YcMAKK5Dm2seEmQi55DfGXcxzco',
    'j6YMX423ugWRRTXsfeHCzRLgBTQ95H1u7r35MZ6mKYTN7rLgdRvq1Efb2PBL')
} catch(err) {
  console.log(err)
}
```

**get all entries**

```js
const found = await this.client.modelFind(this.finderID, 'Folder2P', {})
console.debug('found:', found.entitiesList.length)
this.folders = found.entitiesList.map((entity) => entity).map((obj) => {
  return new YourModel(obj)
})
```

**add an entry**

```js
// matches YourModel and schema
const created = await this.client.modelCreate(this.finderID, 'Folder2', [{
  some: 'data',
  numbers: [1, 2, 3]
}])
```


## React Native

The following has been tested on **Android Only**.

`js-thread-client` should be compatible with React Native. Here are some helpful pointers if you find issues testing it out.

### Connecting to the threads daemon

You can run the daemon released as part of the early preview. To do so, 

```sh
git clone git@github.com:textileio/go-threads.git
cd go-textile-threads
go run threadsd/main.go
```

**Make daemon available to RN**

You can make the daemon API port available to your app with,

```sh
adb reverse tcp:6007 tcp:6007
```

Altenatively, you can ensure this is run whenever you run your app by modifying your `package.json` as follows.

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "bind": "adb reverse tcp:6007 tcp:6007",
    "android": "npm run bind && npx react-native run-android",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

Then, run your app with,

```sh
npm run android
```

### Buffer not found

`js-threads-client` relies on Buffer being available. To make `Buffer` available in your project, you may need to introduce a shim. Here are the steps.

**install rn-nodeify**

read more about [rn-nodeify](https://github.com/tradle/rn-nodeify#readme).

```js
npm install -G rn-nodeify
```

**run nodeify in the root of your project**

```js
rn-nodeify --install buffer --hack
```

This will create a `shim.js` in the root of your project. You need to import this at the top of your apps entry file (e.g. `indes.js`). 

The top of `index.js` would look like, 

```js
require('./shim')
...
```

**add nodeify to your postinstall**

Ensure that the shim is still configured after any module updates. Inside `package.json` add the following line to your `scripts` tag,

```json
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "postinstall": "rn-nodeify --install buffer --hack"
  }
}
```

## Docs

To build the (Markdown-based) documentation output to the `docs` folder, run:

```
npm run docs
```
